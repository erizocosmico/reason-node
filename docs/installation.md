Firt you need to install [esy](https://github.com/esy/), Sandboxed and project based installations that share build artifacts and builds, for lightning fast installations and incremental builds:

```bash
yarn global add esy

# OR with npm

npm install --global esy
```

Then go ahead and add reason-node to your project with esy:

```bash
esy add reason-node
```
